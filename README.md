# DevOps-SaaS

In this project I created two services that communicated with eachother using Python

  One called ping and the other pong.

  I also created a Procfile that was used to help deploy these services in the form of containers on a service called Heroku.


  The purpose of this project was to expand my skills with Python development but also to understand how using containers can improve the efficiency, scalability, and portability of these services. This project also increased my knowledge of the importance of DevOps which makes software development more efficient.
